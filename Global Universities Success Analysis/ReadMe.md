# Overview
The "University Success Analysis" is a comprehensive capstone project exploring the impact of ranking systems on universities. It aims to compare university rankings, evaluate the influence of ranking criteria, and analyze dynamic shifts in university metrics over time.

# Significance
This project holds significant implications for gaining insights into and enhancing the performance of universities. The structured dataset, combined with MECE analysis and Power BI visualizations, enables a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing university success.

# Project Components
## 1. MECE Approach Documentation (Word)
File Name: MECE_Breakdown.docx
Description: Uncover the logic behind the process! This guide provides a closer look at how datasets are systematically analyzed using the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) method.
Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) Approach

The MECE diagram outlines the structured approach applied in dissecting and evaluating the dataset. This method ensures that every component is distinct (Mutually Exclusive) while covering all possibilities (Collectively Exhaustive). It serves as the foundation for uncovering valuable insights and patterns across various dimensions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the data.

## 2. EDA University Data Analysis (Excel)
File Name: University_Success_Analysis_EDA.xlsx
Description: Conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL and Excel. This file includes data aggregation, visualizations, and insightful screenshots for a comprehensive understanding.

## 3. Power BI University Success Analysis (Power BI)
File Name: PowerBI_University_Success_Analysis.pbix
Description: Harness the capabilities of Power BI! This file addresses problem statements, visualizes data, and constructs dashboards for a comprehensive view of university rankings.
